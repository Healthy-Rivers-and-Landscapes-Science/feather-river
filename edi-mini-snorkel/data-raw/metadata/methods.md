## Objectives
The objectives of this study included determining the seasonal distribution of rearing juvenile salmonids and other fishes, and direct and indirect effects of water temperatures, habitat, flow, and interspecific interactions on juvenile salmonids. 

## Sampling Protocol
This study was conducted using a hierarchical sampling design where the survey location represented the general location where a survey was done and a survey section represented the specific area within the survey location that was sampled, and finally the microhabitat plot represented the specific area within the section that was sampled. 

Level 1: Location

Level 2: Section

Level 3: Microhabitat plot

Snorkel surveys were conducted between March and August at 24 sampling locations selected at random (12 in Low Flow Channel, 12 in High Flow Channel). Each section covered an area of 25 meters long and four meters wide and ran parallel to one riverbank. Two divers surveyed the reach by swimming upstream and marking the location of fish observations and the number, species and size of the fish observed. The divers would then measure water depth, average velocity, substrate, cover, and habitat types at 36 points (e.g. the microhabitat plot), each representing one square meter within the reach. The divers also returned to the locations where fish were observed and measured depth and focal velocity associated with each fish observation. Water temperature was continuously monitored through a network of StowAway electronic thermistors. 

## Caveats
Coordinates were not recorded for every survey section. Coordinates were obtained using a handheld GPS unit with a measurement error of about 20 meters. Coordinates were not consistently recorded at the top or bottom of a survey section. Coordinates were not obtained for each microhabitat plot as the measurement error was too large. 
In order, to fill in missing coordinates for survey sections we relied on location information at the next level up in the hierarchy, the survey location. Survey location names were not standardized and were cleaned to group all locations with common names. For survey sections that were missing coordinates or had assumed incorrect coordinates (located outside of the river or inconsistent coordinate and location name), a random coordinate from the appropriate survey location was selected. Coordinates that were filled in using this method are labelled in the dataset.

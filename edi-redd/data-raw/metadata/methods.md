# Objectives

The objectives of this data collection effort are to quantify and understand potential shifts in redd distribution and to quantify potential physical habitat differences (size, substrate, etc.) between historic and restored sites. During the redd surveys, the entirety of restored Gravel Supplementation Areas (GSAs) are inspected for newly developed redds.

# Sampling Protocol

The survey extent is 16 miles extending from Table Mountain Bridge in downtown Oroville, California downstream to the East Gridley Road Bridge near Gridley, California. The surveys, however, have been concentrated in the uppermost two miles (known as the Low Flow Channel) of the lower Feather River in, and adjacent to the GSAs, and are conducted less frequently in the 14 miles downstream (known as the High Flow Channel) of the GSAs. The majority of spawning has been found to occur in the Low Flow Channel. Surveys typically begin in mid-September at the onset of spawning and conclude at the end of November. Surveys in and adjacent to the GSAs are suspended when it is no longer possible to distinguish new redds due to superimposition. For this reason, the duration of the survey period in the GSAs can change between years.

Visual redd surveys are performed by a crew of two staff members wearing polarized sunglasses. The crew members thoroughly search each survey location looking for newly developed redds. A boat is used to locate and position surveyors over redds in deeper sections (greater than 3 ft) of the river where wading is not possible. Only completed redds, identified by a pit and tail spill, are marked and counted. Test redds, those without a completed pit and tail spill, are not marked. 

Redds are recorded geospatially with a Trimble GeoXH 6000 handheld GPS utilizing virtual reference station real time position correction with accuracy of 10 cm or a Juniper Systems Geode GNS3M Multi-Frequency Antennae. A single point is recorded by placing the GPS antennae over the center of the redd to record its location.

Depth, velocity, and substrate data is recorded on every fifth or tenth redd based on time constraints during each survey week. Substrate composition is recorded by visually estimating the percentage of five substrate size categories: fines (less than 1 cm), gravel (1-5 cm), cobble (6-15 cm), large cobble (16-30 cm), and boulder (greater than 30 cm). Physical data (depth, velocity, and substrate) is not recorded for redds where a boat is necessary to collect position data. Depth measurements are recorded with a standard top-setting wading rod at the head and in the pot of the redd. Velocity readings are measured at 60 percent depth at the head of the redd with an Ott MF Pro flowmeter.  

# Caveats

While this data collection effort covers the majority of spawning habitat, it is not a census of all redds due to resource limitations and difficulty distinguishing redds late in the season due to superimposition.

Historically, data were collected only where redds were present. Documentation about when locations were surveyed was used to add information about observations where there were no redds. The published dataset represents redd observations and locations where there were no redds.

Measurements are not available for every redd due to high numbers of redds late in the season and resource limitations.
